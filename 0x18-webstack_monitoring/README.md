In this directory, I am setting up my webstack monitoring logs so I can effectively make chnages and adjustments to it as need be depending on user traffick, downtimes and other factors. Among the litany of data the monitoring service can report to you are system metrics. I can use these metrics to determine statistics such as reads/writes per second, which can help  me determine if/how I should scale.
